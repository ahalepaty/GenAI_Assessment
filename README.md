# Summarizing Legislative Documents
## Use Case Description
Legislative staff are often overwhelmed with the task of transcribing and summarizing hearings, legislation, documents, and official announcements. This process is time-consuming and prone to human error. Generative AI offers a solution by rapidly transcribing and summarizing these materials. By leveraging advanced natural language processing capabilities, AI can produce accurate transcriptions and concise summaries, enabling legislative staff to focus on more strategic tasks. This not only enhances efficiency but also ensures that critical information is captured and communicated effectively.

## Ethical Consideration
1. Data Privacy and Security: Only public, non-sensitive documents (such as legislative texts) are processed. No proprietary, client, or personal data is used, eliminating risk of privacy violations.
2. Transparency and Explainability: The system clearly documents that summaries are AI-generated and may sometimes omit nuanced or context-specific details. Users are encouraged to review the original documents for critical decisions and are informed about how the summarization pipeline works.
3. Accuracy and Reliability: While automated summaries save time, they may introduce errors through misinterpretation. Users are advised to treat AI outputs as supportive—not definitive—resources, and always reference the official text for authoritative use.
4. User Autonomy: The tool is designed for optional and supplementary use, putting users in control of verifying, editing, or disregarding the AI’s suggestions.

Mitigation Steps: 
1. Use only public, approved documents to avoid privacy issues.
2. Provide prominent disclaimers about AI limitations and encourage human review.
3. Randomly sample AI outputs for bias and accuracy checks as part of ongoing improvement.
4. Allow users to access the full source document at any time.

## How GenAI is used in this use case
By using GenAI for both content retrieval and natural language generation, the project transforms bulky, inaccessible policy documents into instantly understandable summaries and answers—saving users time, supporting better decisions, and making public information more accessible.
